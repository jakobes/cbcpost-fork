cbcpost is located at

    https://bitbucket.org/simula_cbc/cbcpost

A *git* workflow is used, and the language is python. There are no
strict guidelines followed, but as a rule of thumb, consider the
following:

- No '*' imports
- No unused imports
- Whitespace instead of tabs
- All modules, public functions and classes should have reasonable docstrings
- 4 space indentation levels
- Unit tests should cover the majority of the code
- Look at existing code, and use common sense

cbcpost will follow the development of FEniCS, and will likely require
development versions of FEniCS-components between releases.
